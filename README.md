# Hello Hooman üêà,
My Name is Rahul Mourya, I'm a Software Developer.  I build `elegant`, `high-performance`, and `easily maintained` web apps.
I have been employed in the tech industry since 2018, I also deliver freelance projects from time to time, and I love teaching people how to code!

I am also open to `open-source` projects, if you're looking for contributors I would be happy to help. Please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:ierahul20@gmail.com) to me if you have any questions, want to hire me for a freelance project, or even seek a mentor.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new places, trying new places to eat, liking cat pictures, or creating digital art.
