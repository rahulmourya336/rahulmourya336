My Name is Rahul Mourya, I'm a Software Developer. I build beautiful, high-performance, and easily maintained web apps.
I have been employed in the tech industry since 2018, I also deliver freelance projects from time to time, and I love teaching people how to code!

I am also open to open-source projects, if you're looking for contributors I would be happy to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions, want to hire me for a freelance project, or even seek a mentor.

Away from the keyboard, I love to explore new places, read books, and sometimes play Badminton.
